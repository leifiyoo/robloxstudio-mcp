**Connect AI assistants like Claude to your Roblox Studio projects**

*20+ tools for project analysis, script editing, and bulk operations*

</div>

---

## What is This?

An MCP server that connects AI assistants (like Claude) to Roblox Studio through a local bridge and plugin. It lets AI explore your game’s structure, read and edit scripts (including ModuleScripts), and perform safe, bulk changes—all locally.

---

## Quick Setup

**Step 1:** Install the Studio plugin (from Releases or your preferred method)

**Step 2:** Enable "Allow HTTP Requests" in Game Settings → Security

**Step 3:** Connect your AI assistant:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y robloxstudio-mcp

# Claude Desktop - add to config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robloxstudio-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "robloxstudio-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Updating from older versions or fixing cache issues:
```bash
npm i robloxstudio-mcp
```

The plugin shows "Connected" when ready.

## What Can You Do?

```text
Project understanding:  "What's the structure of this game?"
Debugging:            "Find possible memory leaks or deprecated APIs"
Mass operations:      "Create 50 test NPCs and position them in a grid"
Script work:          "Explain this weapon system" / "Optimize this movement code"
```

## Why Use This?

- Understand and navigate large projects quickly
- Apply consistent changes at scale (properties, duplication, creation)
- Read and edit script sources programmatically—safely via Studio

## Key Features

- Project analysis and search across services, objects, and scripts
- Script management (read/write) for Script, LocalScript, and ModuleScript
- Mass operations (property edits, smart/mass duplication, calculated/relative properties)
